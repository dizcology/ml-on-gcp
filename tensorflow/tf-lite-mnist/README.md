# TensorFlow Lite MNIST

In this sample we train a convolutional network model following the design of [this tutorial](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial/blob/master/mnist_3.0_convolutional.py), freeze the graph, and export the graph as a TensorFlow Lite model, which can then be used in a mobile app.
